## 🐾 **Overview**
Array Cat is an interactive educational game designed to teach players how to understand and manipulate arrays in programming. The protagonist, a playful cat, reacts emotionally based on the player's success in solving array-related challenges. The game combines fun gameplay with learning opportunities, making it an engaging way to practice coding concepts. While it currently focuses on JavaScript, the game aims to expand support for multiple programming languages in the future.

## Purpose
To be a tool for people who want to learn arrays and how to manipulate them in a fun and entertaining way.

## Method
The user is given the mission to help a cat who is facing challenges in a factory. This setup allows the user to engage in tasks that require array manipulation.

This turns learning arrays into an entertaining and practical challenge. It is ideal for mastering the skills learned and being able to use the acquired capabilities in any future tasks or requirements.
